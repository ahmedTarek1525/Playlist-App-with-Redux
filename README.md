Playlist Application with Redux

This project aims to create a straightforward playlist application. Here are the key features:

Movie List:
Users can click “Add Movie” to randomly generate a movie name and add it to the list.
Each movie entry will have a red “X” button on the right.
Clicking the “X” button will delete the corresponding movie.
Adding a new movie will dynamically update the list.

Songs List:
Similar to movies, users can add and delete songs.
The functionality for songs mirrors that of movies.

Reset Button:
At the top of the app, there’s a “Reset” button.
Clicking it will clear both the movie and song lists.

Redux Concepts Covered:
Understanding the Store and its initial state.
Working with Slices and creating Action Creators.
Connecting React components to Redux.
Managing multiple slices using the Redux Toolkit.
